About ZenoVNC
==============

Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote display system that allows you to
view and interact with a desktop environment that is running on a remote
computer.  Using VNC, you can run graphical applications on a remote machine
and send only the pixels generated by those applications to your local machine.
VNC is platform-independent and supports a wide variety of operating systems
and architectures as both servers and clients.

TurboVNC is a high-speed version of VNC derived from TightVNC.  It contains
a variant of Tight encoding that is tuned to maximize performance for
image-intensive applications (such as VirtualGL, video applications, and image
editors) while still providing excellent performance for other types of
applications.  TurboVNC, in combination with VirtualGL, provides a complete
solution for remotely displaying 3D applications with interactive performance.

Refer to the TurboVNC User's Guide and man pages for a more thorough
description of the components that make up TurboVNC.
